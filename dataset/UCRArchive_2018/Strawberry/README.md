# Strawberry

Food spectrographs are used in chemometrics to classify food types, a task that has obvious applications in food safety and quality assurance. This data was processed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (ATR) sampling. More details are provided in [1][2].

The classes are strawberry purees (authentic samples) and non-strawberry purees (adulterated strawberries and other fruits).
